# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

## What is this for?
This is one of my projects in my Udacity Nanodegree course: Introduction to Programming, under the Python module.
It is a python program which simulates a simple game of Rock vs Paper vs Scissors.

## What does this program do?
The game starts by matching 2 random players selected from a list of players. Each player has its own style of playing.
* A player that only throws rock.
* A player that randomly chooses from a list of moves.
* A player that a human player can control.
* A player that 'learns' what the previous player has thrown and repeats it on the next round.
* A player that cycles through the list of moves.

## What language did you use in making this game?
I used the popular programming languange: Python.

## What have you demonstrated in making this game?
My main objective is to make a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python and apply the principles of __Object Oriented Programming__.

As you can see from how the players are programmed, all players inherit the class of the Player object.
