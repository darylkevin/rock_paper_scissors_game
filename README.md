# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

## What is this for?
This is one of my projects in my Udacity Nanodegree course: Introduction to Programming, under the Python module.
It is a python program which simulates a simple game of Rock vs Paper vs Scissors.

## What does this program do?
The game starts by matching 2 random players selected from a list of players. Each player has its own style of playing.
* A player that only throws rock.
* A player that randomly chooses from a list of moves.
* A player that a human player can control.
* A player that 'learns' what the previous player has thrown and repeats it on the next round.
* A player that cycles through the list of moves.

## What language did you use in making this game?
I used the popular programming languange: Python.

## What have you demonstrated in making this game?
My main objective is to make a simple rock-paper-scissors game using Python and apply the principles of __Object Oriented Programming__.

As you can see from how the players are programmed, all players inherit the class of the Player object.

## Can I try out your game?
Yes! Please try it out!

## Okay. How can I play?
First you need to `clone` the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/darylkevin/rock_paper_scissors_game
```
Then you need to open up your terminal (*NIX based OS) and `cd` into the cloned directory:
```
cd rock_paper_scissors_game
```
Run the .py file using the following command:
```
python3 rock_paper_scissors.py
```

## Is this game also licensed?
Yep. This program is licensed under GPL v2 as of the time of this writing.
